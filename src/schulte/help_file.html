    <p>
        Knowledge of the world is not possible
        without attention. This is the method for
        the development of attention which is
        based on strict scientific basis. The
        method of "Searching symbols" or
        "Schulte Table", was developed as a
        psycho-diagnostic test to study
        the properties of attention by German
        psychiatrist and psychotherapist Walter
        Schulte (1910 - 1972).

# Shultz (Schulte) tables

This software (JavaFX desktop application) is devoted to computerized implementation of the method called "Shultz Tables". This method was invented and designed by psychiatrist and psychotherapist from Germany Walter Shultz (Brainapps, 2018). The methodology was firstly used for a research in the area of measurements of the efficiency of perception and speed of eyes search movements. Method can be described as a series of exercises which uses square tables (or a matrices) of 25 or more cells. Each cell of the table contains a random number from 1 to 25 or any other type of symbols (letters, hieroglyphs, visual images). The goal of an exercise (or a drill) is to find the symbols in the direct sequence from 1 to 25 (or in a different given order) as quickly as possible. 

The project aim is to create computer software which helps a person to achieve his personal goal in self-development and mental activity. Namely, the software can serve as a means of developing personal ability to quickly find information, control focus of attention and widen the field of the eyesight.
